# Hardcore-Survival-Game
## I'm tired... 
Game made for my game prototyping course, which the subject is "make a game of the type that you don't like".
I am so tired that I may not be able to update this game.
But there are some TO-DOs which I hope I can make reality.

- [ ] A Success goal: to safely travel through the map. Kind like a rougelike
- [ ] Better 3D text
- [ ] Adding health and strength system, tool system and building system

## How to play this game?
There's a popover at the beginning of the game. Do follow instruction.

Collect as much resource as you can by consuming food and drink, and picking up flammable before taking it to campfire.
